    """
    Schrodinger equation evolution of a state vector or unitary matrix
    for a given Hamiltonian.

    Evolve the state vector (`psi0`) using a given
    Hamiltonian (`H`), by integrating the set of ordinary differential
    equations that define the system. Alternatively evolve a unitary matrix in
    solving the Schrodinger operator equation.

    The output is either the state vector or unitary matrix at arbitrary points
    in time (`tlist`), or the expectation values of the supplied operators
    (`e_ops`). If e_ops is a callback function, it is invoked for each
    time in `tlist` with time and the state as arguments, and the function
    does not use any return values. e_ops cannot be used in conjunction
    with solving the Schrodinger operator equation

    Parameters
    ----------
    H : :class:`Qobj`, :class:`QobjEvo`
        System Hamiltonian as a Qobj or QobjEvo for time-dependent Hamiltonians.
        list of [:class:`Qobj`, :class:`Coefficient`] or callable that can be
        made into :class:`QobjEvo` are also accepted.

    psi0 : :class:`qutip.qobj`
        initial state vector (ket)
        or initial unitary operator `psi0 = U`

    tlist : *list* / *array*
        list of times for :math:`t`.

    e_ops : :class:`qutip.qobj`, callable, or list.
        Single operator or list of operators for which to evaluate
        expectation values or callable or list of callable.
        Callable signature must be, `f(t: float, state: Qobj)`.
        See :func:`expect` for more detail of operator expectation.

    args : None / *dictionary*
        dictionary of parameters for time-dependent Hamiltonians

    options : None / :class:`qutip.SolverOptions`
        with options for the ODE solver.

    Returns
    -------
    result: :class:`qutip.Result`

        An instance of the class :class:`qutip.Result`, which contains
        a *list of array* `result.expect` of expectation values for the times
        specified by `tlist`, and/or a *list* `result.states` of state vectors
        or density matrices corresponding to the times in `tlist` [if `e_ops`
        is an empty list of `store_states=True` in options].
    """
    solver = SeSolver(H, e_ops, options, tlist, args)
    return solver.run(psi0, tlist, args)


class SeSolver(Solver):
    """
    Schrodinger equation evolution of a state vector or unitary matrix
    for a given Hamiltonian.

    Parameters
    ----------
    H : :class:`Qobj`, :class:`QobjEvo`
        System Hamiltonian as a Qobj or QobjEvo for time-dependent Hamiltonians.
        list of [:class:`Qobj`, :class:`Coefficient`] or callable that can be
        made into :class:`QobjEvo` are also accepted.

    e_ops : :class:`qutip.qobj`, callable, or list.
        Single operator or list of operators for which to evaluate
        expectation values or callable or list of callable.
        Callable signature must be, `f(t: float, state: Qobj)`.
        See :func:`expect` for more detail of operator expectation.

    options : :class:`SolverOptions`
        Options for the solver

    times : array_like
        List of times at which the numpy-array coefficients are applied.
        Used when the hamiltonian is passed as a list with array for coeffients.

    args : dict
        dictionary that contain the arguments for the coeffients
        Used when the hamiltonian is passed as a list or callable.

    methods
    -------
    run(state, tlist, args)
        Evolve the state vector (`psi0`) using a given
        Hamiltonian (`H`), by integrating the set of ordinary differential
        equations that define the system. Alternatively evolve a unitary
        matrix in solving the Schrodinger operator equation.
        return a Result object

    start(state0, t0):
        Set the initial values for an evolution by steps

    step(t, args={}):
        Evolve to `t`. The system arguments for this step can be updated
        with `args`.
        return the state at t (Qobj), does not compute the expectation values.

    attributes
    ----------
    options : SolverOptions
        Options for the solver
        options can be changed between evolution (before `run` and `start`),
        but not between `step`.

    e_ops : list
        list of Qobj or QobjEvo to compute the expectation values.
        Alternatively, function[s] with the signature f(t, state) -> expect
        can be used.
