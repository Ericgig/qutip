    """
    Master equation evolution of a density matrix for a given Hamiltonian and
    set of collapse operators, or a Liouvillian.

    Evolve the state vector or density matrix (`rho0`) using a given
    Hamiltonian or Liouvillian (`H`) and an optional set of collapse operators
    (`c_ops`), by integrating the set of ordinary differential equations
    that define the system. In the absence of collapse operators the system is
    evolved according to the unitary evolution of the Hamiltonian.

    The output is either the state vector at arbitrary points in time
    (`tlist`), or the expectation values of the supplied operators
    (`e_ops`). If e_ops is a callback function, it is invoked for each
    time in `tlist` with time and the state as arguments, and the function
    does not use any return values.

    If either `H` or the Qobj elements in `c_ops` are superoperators, they
    will be treated as direct contributions to the total system Liouvillian.
    This allows the solution of master equations that are not in standard
    Lindblad form.

    **Time-dependent operators**

    For time-dependent problems, `H` and `c_ops` can be a QobjEvo or
    specified in a nested-list format where each element in the list is a list
    of length 2, containing an operator (:class:`qutip.qobj`) at the first
    element and where the second element is either a string
    (*list string format*), a callback function (*list callback format*)
    that evaluates to the time-dependent coefficient for the corresponding
    operator, or a NumPy array (*list array format*) which specifies the value
    of the coefficient to the corresponding operator for each value of t in
    `tlist`. See :class:`qutip.core.QobjEvo` for more detail on building time
    dependent Quantum object.

    Alternatively, `H` and individual `c_ops` can be a callback function with
    the signature `f(t, args) -> Qobj` (*callback format*), which can return
    the Hamiltonian or Liouvillian superoperator at any point in time.  If the
    equation cannot be put in standard Lindblad form, then this time-dependence
    format must be used.

    *Examples*

        H = [[H0, 'sin(w*t)'], [H1, 'sin(2*w*t)']]

        H = [[H0, f0_t], [H1, f1_t]]

        where f0_t and f1_t are python functions with signature f_t(t, args).

        H = [[H0, np.sin(w*tlist)], [H1, np.sin(2*w*tlist)]]

    In the *list string format* and *list callback format*, the string
    expression and the callback function must evaluate to a real or complex
    number (coefficient for the corresponding operator).

    In all cases of time-dependent operators, `args` is a dictionary of
    parameters that is used when evaluating operators. It is passed to the
    callback functions as their second argument.

    **Additional options**

    Additional options to mesolve can be set via the `options` argument, which
    should be an instance of :class:`qutip.solver.SolverOptions`. Many ODE
    integration options can be set this way, and the `store_states` and
    `store_final_state` options can be used to store states even though
    expectation values are requested via the `e_ops` argument.

    .. note::

        If an element in the list-specification of the Hamiltonian or
        the list of collapse operators are in superoperator form it will be
        added to the total Liouvillian of the problem without further
        transformation. This allows for using mesolve for solving master
        equations that are not in standard Lindblad form.

        density matrices corresponding to the times in `tlist` [if `e_ops` is
        an empty list], or nothing if a callback function was given in place of
        operators for which to calculate the expectation values.
