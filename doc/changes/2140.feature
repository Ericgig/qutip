Added flimesolve, "floquet-lndblad master equation solve", for simulation of open sinusoidally-driven quantum systems

Added to associated documentation:
\guide\dynamics\dynamics-floquet - added section about flimesolve
\guide\scripts\floquet_ex4 - identical to floquet_ex3, but using flimesolve instead of fmmesolve
